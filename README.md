# Social Networking Site Backend

## Description
This application contains the bones of a social networking site's backend utilitizing a NOSQL database for a more flexible structure. It has a basic structure for users, posts (called thoughts), friends, and comments (called reactions) and all of the basic behavior needed to interact with these pieces including view all, view one, create, edit, delete, and maintains associations between users and their content as well as users and their associated friends. Right now this application can only be used locally but if you built out a front-end this application would have everything you need to deploy to the web and have a functioning social network database.

## Technologies Used
JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB/Mongoose
